	Unfortunately, the FamilyFellowship.com Internet Filter does not support
	Mac OS.  However, there are a couple of options* available to owners of
	Apple computers who would like to try our Internet Filter.  
</p>

<h3>Virtualization Software</h3>
<p>
	One option is to use virtualization software such as Parallels Desktop or
	VMWare Fusion to run Windows inside of a "window" in Mac OS. You can then
	install The FamilyFellowship.com Internet Filter on this "Virtual Windows".
</p>
<p>
	This will allow you to use the filter inside the virtual windows
	installation. However, it will not filter internet usage on the Mac OS.
	This is a useful situation for some one who wants to try out the filter,
	or who wants to have a means of filtering out unwanted content on a
	voluntary basis.  Unfortunately, this is not a good solution for those who
	do not want or should not have the ability to turn off the filter, since
	doing so is as easy as switching windows.
</p>

<h3>Install Windows on a separate partition</h3>
<p>
	<strong>If you have an Intel Mac and the latest version of Mac OS X</strong>, another option
	is to install Windows on a separate partition, and then install the
	FamilyFellowship.com Internet Filter on the Windows partition.
</p>
<p>
	This would allow you to enjoy all of the benefits of the filter, but allow
	you to reboot into the Mac Os partition whenever you wanted.  Unfortunately,
	this is still not an ideal option for those who do not wish to have the
	ability to turn off the filter, since a simple reboot to the Mac OS partition
	turns off the filter.
