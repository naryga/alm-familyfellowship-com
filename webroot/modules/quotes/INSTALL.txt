For a new installation, copy the entire quotes module directory to the
appropriate module directory within your Drupal installation. Then log
into your site, enable the quotes module on the admin/build/modules
page, set permissions as desired on admin/user/access#module-quotes,
and go to the admin/settings/quotes page to create and configure the
quote blocks.

When upgrading from a previous version of the quotes module, log into
your site as administrative user 1, replace the existing quotes module
directory with the new one, and then go to the /update.php page to
check for and run any necessary upgrades for the quotes module.

If you are upgrading from a pre-4.5 version, you will need to export
and re-import your existing quotes from your pre-4.5 database or
upgrade to Drupal 4.6, to 4.7, and then to 5.

The quotes module has five permissions:

* administer quotes:
    allows users to administer the quotes module and
    create/configure/delete quote blocks
* create quotes:
    allows users to create quotes (they cannot edit quotes without the
    'edit own quotes' permisssion)
* import quotes:
    allows users to import quotes (they cannot edit quotes without the
    'edit own quotes' permission)
* edit own quotes:
    allows users to create, edit, and delete quotes
* promote quotes to block:
    allows users to promote their quotes so that they will appear in
    any defined quote blocks
