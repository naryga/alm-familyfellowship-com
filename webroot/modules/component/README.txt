ABOUT

This module provides several utility routines to allow themers to "pull in" any desired content
in a template file (or anywhere else).  "Any desired content" means a node, block, or view.  Think
of it as a sort of "Panels module junior".

It also provides a series of menu callbacks that return just the corresponding content without the 
full page theming.  That makes them very useful as Ajax callbacks to "fetch a node", "fetch a block", etc.

REQUIREMENTS

- Drupal 5
- Views module (optional)
