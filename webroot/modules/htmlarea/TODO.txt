Critical
--------
- Rewrite htmlarea so that it makes better use of the new drupal js
  extensions and the new formapi.

Important
---------
- Add ability to start and stop Xinha from a chackbox.
- Modify the UploadImage plugin to convert the <img> tags into [img] tags so
  that they can be modified by the image filtering system. This will be done
  by using the image_filter module. This will actually check and make sure
  that the image_filter module is enabled before it uses it.

Completed
---------
- create js for drupal to load drupal plugins without having to move them to
  the xinha plugin directory.
- Interface with fscache to allow images to be uploaded in put into nodes.
- Allow users to edit paramters for plugins.
