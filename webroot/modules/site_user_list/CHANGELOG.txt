    rewrote nearly from scratch.  re-organized most of the functions,
    also use 2-space indents.  start of work towards ability to not
    have either table or view, although this requires subselects, which
    mysql may not support.  modified to make either table or view
    work.

2007 Apr 10
    fix for http://drupal.org/node/134897
    the {$ syntax has special meaning in a double-quoted string
    in php.  Thanks scafmac for the fix!

    temp fix for http://drupal.org/node/134895
    Drupal 5 changed some stuff about $_REQUEST.
    this fix will make things work, although there
    should be a better way to do this.

    - allow changing of page title, per scafmac
      http://drupal.org/node/135409
    - fix to suppress 'view' option if user can't view user profiles
      http://drupal.org/node/135425
      (also scafmac)
      also, move some function calls outside of a loop, which should
      make it a little faster...
    - add ability to control placement and display of display options
      form and search form.  see
      http://drupal.org/node/135186 and http://drupal.org/node/135185
    - add ability to have separate themeing function for each cell
      http://drupal.org/node/135189
    - get rid of functions whose only purpose is to call drupal_get_form

2007 Apr 12
    - optional display of view and edit columns, as well as title option
      see http://drupal.org/node/135425; suggested by scafmac
    - renamed a bunch of variables, so had to create an update function
      to copy over old variables and delete them.

2007 Apr 13
    - Friday the 13th!
    - Can now control which privacy settings are enforced
      see http://drupal.org/node/135641 and http://drupal.org/node/98818
      (same bug/feature request by Haroldc and mimetic2)

2007 Apr 16
    - change from \{$ to {' . $xxx . '}
      the PHP manual is slightly confusing about the "complex" syntax
      and I think that it might be clearer (not to mention solve Haggle's
      issue in http://drupal.org/node/129426) to do it this way

2007 Apr 23
    clean up .info file as per http://drupal.org/node/137122
    thanks jshuster!

    Complete rewrite to majorly change the way things work.
    This change will allow a number of previously hard-to-do things
    to be done more easily.  This introduces a number of hooks to
    allow modules to control how the data is created.  It also
    redoes the administration interface majorly, and introduces
    templates for presentation of cells, which (hopefully) won't be
    too slow.  It also allows users to use a subselect query, if allowed,
    and also does database checks.  Basically, it's the bomb!

2007 May 18
    add hook_enable to run _build
